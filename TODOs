- i change map to unordered_map in header and it doesn't get re-compiled, investigate that

- try to use a U64 instead of move and see if speed better

- add logs to make debugging possible

- test against TSCP in terms of strength, speed (move generation) etc.
  look at https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/12790/how-to-measure-strength-of-my-own-chess-engine
  use Arena and make tscp uci compatible so it can be used with Arena

- analyse and improve search by adding some techniques and also evaluation

- improve quiesce

- end game, improve opening book

- improve evaluation function

- improve uci support

- look at portability, variables, sizes etc

- conventions e.g. name of a class should start with a capital letter e.g. 'move'
